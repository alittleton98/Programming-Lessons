/*
This exercise will be a small dice throwing game to outline the principles of control flow, conditional response, and scope. The player will guess the total value of the dice thrown and the value of each die. The player will also be able to make predication guesses on the output before the dice are thrown.

Scoring Values:
- Total Value Correct: 5pts
- Value of Die Correct: 2.5pts (each)
- Player Predicted Max: 1pt
- Player Predicted Min: 1pt
- Die Values are Equal: 1pt

The maximum number of points awarded is 10 and 1pt scores are only awarded in the case that the player does not get the full 10 points from the Total Value or Die Value scores.
